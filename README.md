# Mental-health-finetuning
Fine tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) with a Mental Health-related dataset

### Goal of the project

Learning LLMs fine tuning from scratch utilizing models like Llama2-7b and mistral-7b.
The dataset is a Mental Health counseling dataset, I'm using it for Supervised fine-tuning.

### Files

I run those file in Google Colab, so they might need some changes to work on a local machine.

- **Fine_Tuning_Llama2.ipynb**
- **Fine_Tuning_Mistral.ipynb** [WIP]
- **Mental_Health_Fine_Tuned_Chatbot.ipynb**

The Fine_Tuning_X.ipynb are for fine-tuning the model X.
The Mental_Health_Fine_Tuned_Chatbot.ipynb file is a LangChain chatbot using the fine-tuned models.

### Future of the project

I would like to try different LLMs and also different types of fine-tuning.
Domain Specific fine tuning and Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback are two things I would like to try.
